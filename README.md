# Pintos-Polytech

This is a repository with a solution to a discipline's lab work from my university. **It is strongly advised not to reuse my reports and my solution** if you do not understand the material. 
You will not receive credit for using someone else's solutions in my university

Labs reports:

* [Pintos Timer](reports/Report_1.pdf)
* [Pintos Threads synch](reports/Report_2.pdf)
* [Pintos Narrow Bridge](reports/Report_3.pdf)
* [Pintos User Programms](reports/Report_4.pdf)

## Important note!

The **lab 3** and **lab 4** solution does not work in this version of Pintos. The problem is most likely with the implementation of lab 2. 
But the code works on clean version of OS, so check there
